# Connect Four Game using TDD (Test Driven Development)

## Created for the Odin Project under the Testing Ruby with Rspec section

Connect Four is a basic game where each player takes turns dropping pieces into the cage. Players win if they manage to get 4 of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal.

See the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) page for more details. 

I built this game using the TDD method.  It is very similar to tic tac toe.
